Stealing once again from my already-written Profile README (and italicizing a few extra things): 

### I'm interested in: 
- **Data Science and Data Communication**. Data should be both _accessible_ and _comprehensible_, and that proper data communication should be _unbiased_ and _informative_. 
- **Physics Education**. I've worked as as a Learning Assistant for SPU's Physics department for the last three years, and have become fascinated with how students formulate ideas about physics. In particular, I'm interested in the connection between students' tacit life experience and how they interpret physics questions through a unique lens.
- **Computer Building & Mechanical Keyboards**! Tinkering with computers has always been a hobby of mine, and I love talking computer hardware with people.
