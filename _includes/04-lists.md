Here's an example list from my GitHub profile README: 

### I'm currently working on: 
- My [honors thesis](https://github.com/jonmgeiger-honors-project), characterizing student ideas in undergraduate physics using Natural Language Processing. 
- [Statistical Learning](https://github.com/jonmgeiger/islr-notes)! I'm making my way through _An Introduction to Statistical Learning_, taking notes and doing exercises as I go. 
- A [collaborative data analysis project](https://github.com/noelgoodwin/household-conditions), looking at household Conditions by geographic school district for my Data Analytics capstone class.
